  By not providing "FindCairo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Cairo", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Cairo" with any of
  the following names:

    CairoConfig.cmake
    cairo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Cairo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Cairo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Cairo"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
